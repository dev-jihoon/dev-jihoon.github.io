Beans are a popular food in many countries.
From black to red, from kidney to pinto, beans are important in the diet of many cultures.
Rich in fiber, protein and nutrients, beans are a healthy, plant-based food.
So, spilling the beans at home or in a store would not be good.
Food is important and does not belong on the floor.
“Spilling the beans” when you communicate with others is also a bad thing.
When you spill the beans, you share or make public secret information.
You don’t mean to do it.
The secrets just spill out of you.
However, this expression does not come from cooking beans or the fact that we shouldn’t waste food.
The expression “spill the beans” has been a part of the English language for hundreds of years.
Some word historians say the term was first used all the way back in the 1500s.
If you think that sounds old, you may be surprised to learn that the origin of “spill the beans” goes back to ancient Greece.
Several websites say this expression comes from one way ancient Greeks voted.
Back then in some communities, people voted by dropping a white or black bean into a clay urn.
If the container fell on its side or broke, the beans would spill out.
And this would show everyone the results of the secret vote before all the beans were counted.
